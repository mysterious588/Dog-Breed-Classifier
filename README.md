## Project Instructions

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.

2. Download the [dog dataset](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-aind/dog-project/dogImages.zip).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/data/dog_Images`.  The `dog_Images/` folder should contain 133 folders, each corresponding to a different dog breed.
3. Download the [human dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw.tgz).  Unzip the folder and place it in the repo, at location `path/to/dog-project/data/lfw`.
4. Run the cells in [dog_app.ipynl]
